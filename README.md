## Use of submodules

This repository is using nested submodules. Submodules are repositories that are included in the base repository and are complementary. Submodule repositories are maintained elsewhere and shall be pulled separately after cloning this repository. 

To clone this repository including its submodules you can use the ```--recursive``` parameter.

```
git clone --recursive [URL to Git repo]
```

If you already have cloned the repository and now want to load itâ€™s submodules you have to use submodule update.

```
git submodule update --init
# if there are nested submodules:
git submodule update --init --force --remote
```
